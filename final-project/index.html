<div id="content">

  <p>MIAMI — With the Kansas City Chiefs trailing the San Francisco 49ers by double digits in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl LIV, Patrick Mahomes was tasked with a daunting mission. No starting quarterback in league history had ever led three such postseason comebacks. But once again, Mahomes showed he is unlike any other quarterback that has graced the NFL.</p>

  <p>This Super Bowl was projected to be extremely close with the Chiefs firepower offense going up against the 49ers dominant defense. It was strength versus strength and many expected this to be tight up until the final seconds.</p>

  <p>The first half proved to be just that. It was a very even contest through 30 minutes, with the scoreboard reading 10-10 going into halftime. The 49ers struck first, putting up three points on a 38 yard field goal from Robbie Gould. However, the Chiefs responded right away with a dominant 15 play, 75 yard touchdown drive that took up more than seven minutes of the clock. Then a Chiefs field goal and a 49ers touchdown drive full of large chunk plays put the game into a stalemate heading into halftime</p>

  <p>However, Kyle Shanahan got his 49ers team fired up coming out of the locker room for the second half.</p>

  </script>

<h2>49ers Put Together a Dominant Third Quarter</h2>

  <p>The 49ers came out hot, scoring 10 points in the third quarter and forcing Mahomes to throw two interceptions on back-to-back drives.</p>

  <p>However, they couldn't keep Mahomes down long as he lead the Chiefs on a 10 play, 83 yard drive in just over two and a half minutes, cutting into the 49ers lead.</p>

  <p>The second-year starter threw two touchdown passes in the final six minutes to beat the 49ers, 31-20, at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday night and give the Chiefs their second title in franchise history.</p>

  <p>With the victory, Mahomes became the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl and a league MVP (a feat he accomplished in 2018). He also became the youngest quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP.</p>

  <p>When the Chiefs took possession down 20-10 in the fourth quarter, it did not seem likely that they would be able to pull off another one of their signature comebacks. San Francisco’s defense had played as well as advertised, constantly attacking Mahomes and forcing the two interceptions in the third quarter.</p>

  <p>“I didn’t play to my liking in that third quarter,” Mahomes said. “But the guys believed in me and gave me confidence.”</p>

  <p>After his rough third quarter, Mahomes and the Chiefs offense figured out the 49ers stingy defense

<h2>The Comeback Begins</h2>

  <p>Facing a third-and-15 with seven minutes remaining, the Chiefs needed Mahomes to replicate the same magic he had showed earlier in their postseason run. He had already led the team to double-digit comebacks in their two previous playoff wins against the Houston Texans and the Tennessee Titans.</p>

  <p>So Mahomes did just that. He moved out of the pocket and threw a 44-yard strike to wide receiver Tyreek Hill, then followed it up with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Travis Kelce to pull Kansas City within three points of the lead.</p>

  <p>After Mahomes zipped a 38-yard pass to wide receiver Sammy Watkins, he threw a five-yard touchdown to running back Damien Williams. The Chiefs fans in the crowd let loose a roar as their team took a 24-20 lead with less than three minutes to play.</p>

  <p>“It’s magic Mahomes,” Kelce said. “He’s going to be himself no matter what the scenario is.”</p>

  <p>The 49ers got the ball back with just under three minutes to go and a chance to score a touchdown to take the lead. After two first downs on big plays by Raheem Mostert and Deebo Samuel, the 49ers offense just didn't have enough firepower to get close to the endzone.

  <p>The 49ers failed to convert a fourth down and handed the ball back to the Chiefs. Two plays later, Williams broke up the left sideline for a 38-yard touchdown run that put the exclamation mark on Kansas City’s first Super Bowl in 50 years.</p>

  <p>Mahomes threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown. Williams rushed for 104 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. Hill caught nine passes for 105 yards.</p>

  <p>San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo bested Mahomes early but faltered late. With 57 seconds remaining, he threw an interception to Kansas City cornerback Kendall Fuller that sealed the Chiefs’ win.</p>

<h2>MVP Mahomes</h2>

  <p>Kansas City’s offense retook the field, and Mahomes threw the ball in a long arc as the final seconds ticked away. Confetti shot out as the Chiefs embraced one another, knowing their city can finally rejoice after decades of waiting.</p>

  <p>Mahomes won the prestigious Super Bowl MVP award, adding to an already impressive list of accolades for the 24 year old. The Chiefs quarterback has now won a Super Bowl, Super Bowl MVP and NFL MVP, as well as being a two time pro bowler and a member of the first team All-Pro team.</p>

  <p>Mahomes became the youngest quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP after leading the Chiefs to their third straight come from behind victory in the playoffs, with the final being the most memorable and important of the three.</p>

  <p>“Just to be here is surreal,” Mahomes said. “We’ll enjoy this for a long time.”</p>
